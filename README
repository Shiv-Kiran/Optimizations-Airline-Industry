=================================== DESCRIPTION OF CODE ===================================



==> The solver.py file has functions that solve for the optimal solution, given the schedule, probabilities, costs as input.
    This file acts as a helper file for the airport_simul.py file.

==> airport_simul.py has the code to run each alogorithm, for 5 different schedules... in order to take an avergae cost.
    Also it does the above for 4 different probability profiles,

==> each probability profile has 4 probabilities, for 4 different capacity scenarious, which are fixed.
    for example we have 4 capacity scenarious C1, C2, C3, C4, then a profile of P = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] means that
    the probability of C1 is 0.1, C2 is 0.2, C3 is 0.3 and C4 is 0.4.

==> You can change the line 105 in the code, to study the effect of chaange of the air delay cost per period.
    By default, it is 750$/period

==> And if you run airport_simul.py, it creates a file stats.pkl in the current folder. THis file has all the data recorded from all the experiments.

==> Finally analyse.py analyses the stats.pkl file, computes averge costs, delays etc and creates all the plots shown in the report.
